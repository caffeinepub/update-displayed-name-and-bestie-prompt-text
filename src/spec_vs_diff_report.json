  "summary": "REQ-7 asks to deploy/publish the already-updated Valentine page so the shareable link shows the exact prompt text live. The diff only adds documentation and code/config changes; it does not provide evidence of an actual production deployment/publish action tied to the specified shareable URL. Several unrequested changes were introduced (publishing doc, cache-control headers, backend change, and additional UI copy/behavior).",

      "reason": "The diff contains no evidence of an actual deployment/publish step or configuration that would ensure the specified shareable link now serves the latest deployed (non-draft) version. It only adds a manual checklist document and local code changes; acceptance criteria about the live link and hard refresh/incognito behavior cannot be confirmed from the diff.",
